# CI/CD Pipeline Setup for MeroDocs ICP Canister

This document explains how to set up and use the CI/CD pipeline for deploying your ICP canister.

## üöÄ Pipeline Overview

The pipeline uses a **single job** that builds and deploys the canister in one streamlined process.

### **Deployment Triggers**

- **Automatic**: Push git tags following semver pattern (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`)
- **Manual**: Using GitHub Actions "Run workflow" button with options for:
  - Environment: `mainnet` or `local`
  - Cycles amount: Configurable (default: 1.0 trillion)

### **Release Process**

Create and push a git tag to trigger automatic deployment:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### **Build and Deploy Process**

The pipeline performs these steps in sequence:

1. ‚úÖ Sets up Rust toolchain with WASM32 target
2. ‚úÖ Caches dependencies for faster builds
3. ‚úÖ Installs dfx and candid-extractor tools
4. ‚úÖ Configures identity (mainnet only)
5. ‚úÖ Builds canister with dfx
6. ‚úÖ Generates WASM and Candid interface
7. ‚úÖ Deploys to target network
8. ‚úÖ Outputs canister ID and URL

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate DFX Identity for CI/CD

First, create a new identity specifically for deployments:

```bash
# Create a new identity
dfx identity new ci-deployment
dfx identity use ci-deployment

# Get the principal ID (you'll need this for cycles management)
dfx identity get-principal

# Export the identity to PEM format
dfx identity export ci-deployment > ci-identity.pem
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions, and add:

#### Required Secrets:

- **`DFX_IDENTITY_PEM`**: Contents of the `ci-identity.pem` file you generated

> **Note**: This secret is only required for mainnet deployments. Local deployments use the default identity.

### 3. Fund Your Deployment Identity

Your deployment identity needs cycles to create and manage canisters:

```bash
# Switch to your funded identity
dfx identity use default  # or your main identity

# Transfer ICP to the deployment identity
dfx ledger transfer --amount 0.5 --to $(dfx identity get-principal ci-deployment)

# Convert ICP to cycles (using deployment identity)
dfx identity use ci-deployment
dfx cycles convert --amount 0.4
```

## üìã Usage

### Creating a Release

1. **Make your changes** and commit them to your branch
2. **Merge to main/master** branch
3. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git tag v1.0.0  # Use semantic versioning
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

The pipeline will automatically:

- Build the canister for WASM32 target
- Generate Candid interface
- Deploy to ICP mainnet with 1T cycles (default)
- Provide canister ID and URL in the GitHub Actions summary

### Manual Deployment

You can trigger deployments manually with custom options:

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy ICP Canister" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure options:
   - **Environment**: Choose `mainnet` or `local`
   - **Cycles**: Specify amount in trillions (e.g., `1.5` for 1.5T cycles)
5. Click "Run workflow"

The pipeline will build and deploy to your chosen environment with the specified cycles allocation.

### Testing Before Release

Before creating a release tag, test locally:

```bash
cd merodocs_registry
./test-deployment.sh
```

This script will:

- Check prerequisites
- Build the canister locally
- Deploy to local dfx instance
- Provide testing URLs

## üìä Pipeline Workflow

The simplified workflow runs as a single job:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Push Tag v*.*.*] --> B[Build and Deploy Job]
    C[Manual Trigger] --> B
    
    B --> D[Setup Rust + Tools]
    D --> E[Configure Identity]
    E --> F[Build Canister]
    F --> G[Deploy to Network]
    G --> H[Output URLs]
    
    H --> I[‚úÖ Success]

    style I fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Key Features:**
- Single job execution (faster, simpler)
- Network-aware deployment (local vs mainnet)
- Configurable cycles allocation
- Automatic cleanup for local deployments

## üîç Monitoring Deployments

After deployment, you can monitor your canister:

### Canister URLs:

- **Main Interface**: `https://{CANISTER_ID}.icp0.io`
- **Candid UI**: `https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id={CANISTER_ID}`

### Useful dfx Commands:

```bash
# Check canister status
dfx canister --network ic status backend

# View canister info
dfx canister --network ic info backend

# Check cycles balance
dfx canister --network ic status backend --with-cycles
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Pipeline fails with "insufficient cycles":**
- Fund your deployment identity with more ICP/cycles
- Increase cycles amount in manual deployment
- Check: `dfx wallet --network ic balance`

**Build fails:**
- Check Rust version compatibility (currently: v1.89.0)
- Ensure dfx version matches (currently: v0.28.0)
- Test locally: `dfx build` in the merodocs_registry directory

**Identity issues:**
- Regenerate the identity PEM and update the GitHub secret
- Ensure the identity has sufficient cycles for mainnet deployment
- Local deployments don't require identity setup

**Local deployment issues:**
- Ensure dfx is not already running locally
- Pipeline automatically manages local dfx lifecycle

### Pipeline-Specific Issues:

**"bc: command not found":**
- This is handled automatically in the pipeline (basic calculator for cycles conversion)

**Tool installation failures:**
- Pipeline uses official installers for dfx and cargo tools
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific tool installation errors

### Getting Help:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Test the deployment locally: `dfx build && dfx deploy`
3. Verify your dfx version: `dfx --version` (should be 0.28.0)
4. For local testing, ensure no other dfx instances are running
